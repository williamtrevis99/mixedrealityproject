A mixed reality project using the Microsoft Hololens

## This project uses the Microsoft Hololens https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens

## The aim of this project is to find, develop and prototype real world uses for the Hololens in the automotive sector

### Inspiration 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QyA7HhIYkg - FORD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvLdbpICVGk - VOLVO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEaS0yMmP74 - Integrated car systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pww0Px3rcf8 - FORD car design 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egdX9MZ_YTE - Technical specification 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VqOipWugqI - Car customiser 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCChPK7l5Xo - Bike maintenance 

## Key aspects of the project. 

* Value - what value does this prototype bring to the industry?
* Usability - can the intended users use the product with ease? Is there a learning curve? 
* Scalability - is this prototype something which a lot of people can use? Too complicated? Hardware too expensive? 
* Developability - is this something that can be developed efficiently, on time and on budget? 
* Feasability - can this prototype be developed? Should it be developed?

## Main potential use cases 

---

### Customisable car model in store 

Allows users to see a customisable 3d model of a vehicle in store, look through the car and check out specific technical specifications of parts. 

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VqOipWugqI - Car customiser 

#### Targeted users

Customers and sales representatives. 

#### Value 

Allow sales reps to show customers in depth details of models, different customisable options and a cool 3d model of any car in-stock or not!

#### Usability 

Learning curve to learn the software. Potentially too difficult to use/maintain. 

#### Scalability 

Hololens is currently too expensive for realistic domestic use. In store distrubtion is also potentially too expensive. 

#### Developability 

Previous examples can be seen on the internet, so *it can be done*. Usually done using unity or similar development engines. 

#### Feasability

The main issue is the accessability of the Hololens. Is it financially realistic to expect a company to purchase a Hololens for every store they own? Additionally is it easy enough for customers to use on a one off occasion if it is?

### Repair/maintenance mapping overlay 

Allows users to see the systems in mixed reality highlighted on a car. 

Example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCChPK7l5Xo - Bike maintenance 

#### Targeted users

Technicians and mechanics.  

#### Value 

Allows users to easily see systems and their states, reducing potential repair times. Especially useful when dealing with large car documentations and specifications which can be a pain to look up. This information can now be at the tip of your fingers. 

#### Usability 

Users would use the product during repair and when needed to make accessing information easier. Potential daily use. 

#### Scalability 

Potential distribution of the hardware to all workshops could be too expensive.

#### Developability 

Previous examples can be seen on the internet, so *it can be done*. Usually done using unity or similar development engines. 

#### Feasability

The main issue is the accessability of the Hololens and whether the Hololens can usefully assist technicians in any meaningful way. For example does the experienced mechanic know the torques off by heart, rather than needing to go through a process to access that information.
